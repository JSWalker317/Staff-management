## Staff Tool-Management

Laravel is a web application framework with expressive, elegant syntax. We believe development must be an enjoyable and creative experience to be truly fulfilling. Laravel takes the pain out of development by easing common tasks used in many web projects, such as:

- .env (APP_URL: your_ip)
- docker-compose build
- docker-compose up -d
- docker-compose exec app php artisan config:cache
- docker-compose exec app php artisan migrate:fresh --seed
